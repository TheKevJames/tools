// We import the CSS which is extracted to its own file by esbuild.
// Remove this line if you add a your own CSS build pipeline (e.g postcss).
import "../css/app.css"

// If you want to use Phoenix channels, run `mix help phx.gen.channel`
// to get started and then uncomment the line below.
// import "./user_socket.js"

// You can include dependencies in two ways.
//
// The simplest option is to put them in assets/vendor and
// import them using relative paths:
//
//     import "./vendor/some-package.js"
//
// Alternatively, you can `npm install some-package` and import
// them using a path starting with the package name:
//
//     import "some-package"
//

// Include phoenix_html to handle method=PUT/DELETE in forms and buttons.
import "phoenix_html"
